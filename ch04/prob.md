# Probability, distributions and random sampling

We will discuss:
- probability and conditional probability
- standard normal distribution
- sampling distribution
- error bar charts

## Probability

```Definition
*Probability* is the likelihood that an event of interest occurs.
```

Probability is an important concept in everyday life. We express usually in the form of a decimal number ranging from 0 to 1, 0 means the event will *definitely not* happen and 1 means it will *definitely* happen.

Intuitively, we see, that by tossing a coin we have a chance of 0.5 to yield heads or tails.

Sometimes we find also probabilities expressed as percentages, a format more intuitively accessible for many people. To calculate a percentage from the decimal probability, just multiply it by $100\%$. The probability of obtaining heads by tossing a coin is $50\%$ ($0.5 \times 100\%$).
