# About the book

This book is written because, we find that existing textbooks lack of some desired features. A lot of great classical statistic textbooks introduce the concepts in a very strict mathematical sense and develop formulas from first principles. This way of teaching can give a deep understanding of the underlaying maths, but only for people trained in mathematics. This is often not the case, especially for students outside the natural sciences. A book that comes very close to our needs is Dancey's and Reidy's *'Statistics without Maths for Psychology'*, but it uses the commercial SPSS software system (our organisation of the material is strongly influenced by this really good book).

A second major point for us is the usage of open software in science. We didn't want to be dependant from a software vendor in our research methodology; so we want open software that could be modified if desired. For students and teaching, open software has the plus to be free of charge. We think, students should not be forced to buy a commercial statistic package for their courses or thesis. This yields us to the need of a book using the *R language for statistical computing* alongside the text. Until now, some really good books about the *R* language were published, some of them serve as more technical guides or cookbooks to solve very specific problems. Others present also a lot of statistical background. In this book, we limit the explanations to the stuff needed in typical one semester courses of statistics. We want to cover natural science and social science curricula to the same attend; so you may not need to study every single chapter if you only want to pass the exam in your specific field of study. On the other hand, if you go through all the presented material, you should gain a good basic understanding for relevant techniques useful for your research.

We want to skip formulas from the text as far as possible. We try to explain all concepts 'without maths' and show concrete calculations (with values instead of variables) for illustration. The teaching reality for us is, that all relevant calculations where done with the computer and not by hand. So we try to illustrate all concepts with code written in *R* and not with formulas. We also use a very informal and personal language and try to keep the text readable. If in doubt, we allow ourself to be less formal (and sometimes also less exact) in favour for ease of understanding. 

If you walk through the material and understand the ideas behind them, it should also be more easy for you to read afterwards a more mathematical book on statistics and find the relevant stuff for your situation.
